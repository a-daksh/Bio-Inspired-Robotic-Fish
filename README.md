## Project Overview
This project involves the design and development of a bio-inspired robotic fish, capable of mimicking natural fish movements for propulsion and buoyancy control. The fish tail uses a tendon-based mechanism to create a realistic left-right swimming motion, while a motor-controlled syringe adjusts buoyancy, allowing the fish to sink and rise in water.

### Key Features
- **Nested Conical Structure**: A series of tapered cones connected at a single pivot point allows for smooth, flexible tail movement.
- **Tendon-Based Mechanism**: Servo motors control tendons that generate fish-like swimming dynamics by rotating the conical sections.
- **Buoyancy Control**: A motorized syringe changes internal fluid levels to regulate buoyancy, enabling the fish to precisely control its depth.
  
## Components
- **3D Printed Tail Segments**: Designed to taper and fit within each other, ensuring efficient motion.
- **Servo Motor System**: Provides actuation for the tendon mechanism, enabling left and right tail flexing.
- **Motor-Controlled Syringe**: Adjusts buoyancy by injecting or removing water from an internal reservoir.
