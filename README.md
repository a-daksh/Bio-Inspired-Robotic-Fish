# Robotic-Fish
The Robotic fish is a bio-mimicking robot that replicates the motion of a fish and can be used for underwater mapping and surveillance

-The robot uses a servo-based 3D printed mechanism that oscillates the fishâ€™s tail fin, allowing forward motion.

-It houses a syringe, for buoyancy control, allowing the robot to adjust its height underwater.

-The robot can be controlled using an online server hosted onto the microcontroller (Raspberry-pi) which also controls the motion of the fish.
